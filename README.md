# My projects

This is a repo that contains various different projects that i have worked on or i am currently working on



## BMI-calculator

The bmi-calculator folder contains a rather simple BMI-calculator that is made whilst on holiday in England. I wanted to try out Tkinter, as i struggle with frontend design. It would be a good idea to split up the frontend and backend in to different files, but i couldn't find an effective way of doing this. I might improve functionality by adding the imperial system to the app at some point. 


## Terminal-Yatzy-Game

The terminal-yatzy-folder currently contains the initial commit of a application that will allow you to play yatzy purely in the terminal. I have a few ideas of how i would like to do it, however i can't quite decide what is best. 


## Text-Encrypter

The text-encrypter folder contains a very simple text-encryption app. It uses the "cryptocode" library to encode and uncode messages with a key. Originally i wanted to create my own encryption algorithm, howevever this proved to be fair to difficult. 
I made a rough version of one, but it was way to easily cracked. This app also makes use of the Tkinter library to create a passable GUI.
