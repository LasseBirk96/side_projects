# My projects

This is a repo that contains various different projects that i have worked on or i am currently working on



## BMI-calculator

The bmi-calculator folder contains a rather simple BMI-calculator that is made whilst on holiday in England. I wanted to try out Tkinter, as i struggle with frontend design. It would be a good idea to split up the frontend and backend in to different files, but i couldn't find an effective way of doing this. I might improve functionality by adding the imperial system to the app at some point. 


## Terminal-Yatzy-Game

The terminal-yatzy-folder currently contains the initial commit of a application that will allow you to play yatzy purely in the terminal. I have a few ideas of how i would like to do it, however i can't quite decide what is best.
